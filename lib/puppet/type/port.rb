    @doc = "Installs and manages port entries. For most systems, these
      entries will just be in `/etc/services`, but some systems (notably OS X)
      will have different solutions.

      This type uses a composite key of (port) `name` and (port) `number` to
      identify a resource. You are able to set both keys with the resource
      title if you seperate them with a slash. So instead of specifying protocol
      explicitly:

          port { \"telnet\":
            protocol => tcp,
            number   => 23,
          }

      you can also specify both name and protocol implicitly through the title:

          port { \"telnet/tcp\":
            number => 23,
          }

      The second way is the prefered way if you want to specifiy a port that
      uses both tcp and udp as a protocol. You need to define two resources
      for such a port but the resource title still has to be unique.

      Example: To make sure you have the telnet port in your `/etc/services`
      file you will now write:

          port { \"telnet/tcp\":
            number => 23,
          }
          port { \"telnet/udp\":
            number => 23,
          }

      Currently only tcp and udp are supported and recognised when setting
      the protocol via the title."

      [
        # we have two title_patterns "name" and "name:protocol". We won't use
        # one pattern (that will eventually set :protocol to nil) because we
        # want to use a default value for :protocol. And that does only work
        # when :protocol is not put in the parameter hash while initialising
        [
          /^(.*)\/(tcp|udp)$/, # Set name and protocol
